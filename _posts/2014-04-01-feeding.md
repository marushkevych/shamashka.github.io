I started introducing solids when Ivan was four and a half weeks. I did not want to rush into it, but he was showing so much interest in our food that I started experimenting, testing whether his interest for food is strong enough and whether he actually wants to taste and swallow. First he had a peeled organic carrot from the fridge to rub his gums, and he seemed to appreciate it much more than the teether rings we tried giving him before. 

In a couple of days I cooked some organic white rice and creamed it, mixing in a bit of breast milk. I offered Ivan just a small taste of it, maybe a teaspoon. He seemed interested and finished all I offered.
